# HarranUniversityProgrammingTask

This program is designed to store information about disaster victims and their help requests. It allows the user to add, update, and delete victims, as well as add help requests associated with the victims. The program has a menu system that guides the user through the different operations.

The program stores victim information in arrays, with separate arrays for name, surname, phone number, and address. It also stores the IDs of victims in another array, which is used to associate help requests with the correct victim.

The program has several functions, including functions to add, update, and delete victims, and to add help requests. There are also functions to list victims and their associated help requests, and to search for a victim by ID.

The program uses custom functions to perform tasks that are not available in the standard library, such as string copying and string length calculation. It also uses the random number generator to assign IDs to victims.

There are error checking mechanisms in place to ensure that the data entered by the user does not exceed the maximum length allowed for each field. If an error occurs, an error message is displayed, and the user is returned to the menu system. The program also allows the user to return to the menu system after completing a task or exit the program entirely.

Overall, this program is designed to efficiently manage the information of disaster victims and their help requests.
